👋 Hi there! 

I'm Nedim Bečić, a 3rd-year Computer Science student at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Sarajevo, specializing in Computing and Informatics. I have a passion for solving complex puzzles and tackling problems through programming. In my free time, you can find me exploring new places, challenging myself in chess, or occasionally solving a Rubik's cube.
